        <h1>STUPID PEOPLE PISS ME OFF!</h1>
        <p>
            One time, when I was on a drive somewhere, I was at a really stupidly designed intersection.<br>
            Basically, it was a 4-way, with a minor arterial road going one way, and 2 local roads,<br>
            but if you are comming off of the local roads, and the light is green, it is a signal for<br>
            all traffic on those two roads to move; meaning that if you are turning right, you gotta wait<br>
            for every other person on the intersection to get out first. Eventually on that intersection<br>
            I was finally able to go, but long in the distance, some absolutly <b>retarded</b> ute driver<br>
            is going 90 to race the red light: and they were on a crash course straight for my car!<br>
            If the idiot didn't swerve right last second I would be DEAD!
        </p>
        <h3>Hopefully this explains my issue with stupid people</h3>
        <p>
            Now, let's address the elephant in the room...
        </p>
        <h1>Aren't you stupid, Sebastian?</h1>
        <p>
            No. 
        </p>
        <h1>How can we trust you?</h1>
        <p title="Let's say, hypothetically speaking...">
            Uhh... idk?
        </p>
        <h1>Really?...</h1>
        <p title="...that that would be your mother...">
            Fine! Maybe I'm stupid! Maybe it was me in the ute who raced the red light!
        </p>
        <h1>wtf</h1>
        <p title="...then, hypothetically, wouldn't that make you president of his fan club or something?">
            Nah I'm kidding. I would never be stupid.
