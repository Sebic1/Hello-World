        Hi, I'm Sebastian Ilic and I go to school. Nothing much happens at school so it's kinda boring. <br>
        I just recently got back into programming because of my friend Rory, who showed me how fun it is <br>
        and what things there are to do. I plan on doing more stuff with this website, but in the meantime, <br>
        stay tuned for changes!
